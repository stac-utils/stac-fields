# stac-fields

A minimal STAC library that contains a list of STAC fields with some metadata (title, unit, prefix) and helper functions for styling as HTML.

Version: **1.5.6**

## Usage

Add to your project with `npm install @radiantearth/stac-fields --save`

Import the utilities to format values:

```js
const StacFields = require('@radiantearth/stac-fields');
```

or

```js
import StacFields from '@radiantearth/stac-fields';
```

Format a value:

```js
let stacItem = {
    stac_version: '1.0.0',
    id: '...',
    properties: {
        datetime: '2020-01-01T13:55:43Z',
        'radiant:public_access': true,
        ...
    },
    ...
};

// Add custom extension and field(s)
StacFields.Registry.addExtension('radiant', 'Radiant Earth');
StacFields.Registry.addMetadataField('radiant:public_access', {
    label: "Data Access",
    formatter: (value) => value ? "Public" : "Private"
});

// Option 1: Manually iterate through properties and format them
for(let field in stacItem.properties) {
    let value = stacItem.properties[field];
    let formatted = StacFields.format(value, field, stacItem);
    let label = StacFields.label(field);
    console.log(label, formatted);
}

// Option 2: Group by extension and format item properties
// The second parameter is a filter function to skip specific properties or paths, remove to get all properties
let groups = StacFields.formatItemProperties(stacItem, (key, path) => key !== 'eo:bands');
```

To filter by path (remove all common_name fields from bands):

```js
let groups = StacFields.formatItemProperties(stacItem, (key, path) => !(path[0] === 'eo:bands' && path[2] === 'common_name'));
```

This library is written for the latest version of the STAC specification (1.0.0-rc.4).
It is recommended to pass your STAC data through a migration tool like
[`@radiantearth/stac-migrate`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@radiantearth/stac-migrate)
before so that it complies to the latest STAC version. Otherwise some fields may not be handled correctly.

Non-JavaScript library authors can re-use the `fields.json`. It is available at:
<https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@radiantearth/stac-fields/fields.json>

## fields.json

This is a file defining useful metadata about extensions and metadata fields.
In general, the fields.json only lists fields that are either backed by a released extension or have at least one public catalog implementing it.

The following options are available in the object:

* `label`: The human-readable title for the value.
* `format`: The name of the formatter in formatters.js, but without the leading `format`.
* `formatter`: A formatter function that is compatible to the formatters defined in formatters.js. Use this if no suitable pre-defined formatter is available to be specified in `format`. See also [Custom Formatters](#custom-formatters) for more details.
* `ext`: Specify the extension key here, if the field belongs to an extension that has no prefix or so.
* `unit`: A unit to add after the value.
* `explain`: A long form for an abbreviation that should be shown in a tooltip. Can also be a http or https link, which shows a link instead of an abbreviation.
* `mapping`: A map with the keys being the original (stringified lower-case) value and the values being the values shown to users.
* `custom`: A structure that can't easily be rendered with any of the pre-defined formatters and thus needs a custom implementation (see `externalRenderer`).
* `alias`: If a field has multiple keys, declare the field to use the specification of the other field.
* `listWithKeys`: Set to `true` to allow the option `items` to specify items in an object of objects (like assets). Defaults to `false`.
* `items`: If the value is an array of objects (or an object of objects if `listWithKeys` has ben set), a table can be created with the details in this object. It has the same structure as specified here, but in additon `sortable` and `id` are allowed:
    * `sortable`: Specfiies whether the value can be sorted (`true`, e.g. in a table) or not (`false`). Defaults to `false`.
    * `id`: Specfiies whether the value is the unique primary key (`true`) or not (`false`). Defaults to `false`.
    * `default`: If no value is present, this value will be used instead.
* `properties`: If the value is an object, specify the properties.
* `null`: The value that should be given instead of `null`. If a value is null but this property is not given, defaults to "n/a".
* Options related to Collection Summaries:
    * `summary`: Gives an indication how the field should be summarized:
        * `false` (boolean): Don't summarize
        * `r` (string): Summarize as Range Object (minimum and maximum value)
        * `v` (string): Summarize as array of all values (may require merging arrays)
        * `s` (string): Summarize as JSON Schema Object (usually for very complex values or very long non-numerical lists of values)
        * `true` (boolean) or not set: Detect based on the given data type of the values. Use Range Objects for numerical values, use JSON Schema Objects for objects and all other data types provide as array of all values.
    * `order`: The order of the items in ascending order, e.g. for a table. If not given, the first entry is always the item with `id` set to `true`, all other items are in alphabetic order.

If only a label is available, it can be passed as string instead of an object.

Some details about the fields included in the fields.json file can be found [here](fields.md).

There is also a `fields-normalized.json`, which is a normalized version of the fields.json.
All non-Javascript users will probably prefer to use the `fields-normalized.json` as it already
has the `alias`es resolved and all fields and extensions are defined as objects for easier handling.

## formatters.js

The most important methods are:

* `format(value: any, field: string, spec: object, context: object = null, parent: object = null, filter: function = null, path: array = []) => string`: Applies the right formatting depending on the data type of the a single property.
* `label(key: string, spec: object = null)`: Formats a label according to the rules given in `spec`. By default uses the metadata labels from fields.json.
* `extension(key: string) => string`: Formats an extension, similar to `label`.
* `formatAsset(asset: object, context: object, filter: function = null, coreKey: string = '') => object`: Formats an asset. Also groups by extension per asset.
* `formatLink(link: object, context: object, filter: function = null, coreKey: string = '') => object`: Formats a link. Also groups by extension per link.
* `formatProvider(provider: object, context: object, filter: function = null, coreKey: string = '') => object`: Formats a provider. Also groups by extension per provider.
* `formatCollection(collection: object, filter: function = null, coreKey: string = '') => object`: Formats a collection. Also groups by extension. *Experimental!*
* `formatCatalog(catalog: object, filter: function = null, coreKey: string = '') => object`: Formats a catalog. Also groups by extension. *Experimental!*
* `formatSummaries(collection: object, filter: function = null, coreKey: string = '') => object`: Formats the summaries in a collection. Also groups by extension. The filter only works on the top-level!
* `formatItemProperties(item: object, filter: function = null, coreKey: string = '') => object`: Formats the properties in an Item. Also groups by extension.

### Pre-defined formatters (`Formatters`)

* Checksum (multihashes, show original hash and hashing algorithm)
* CommonMark
   Use the following code to allow rendering HTML in CommonMark:
   ```js
   import { Formatters } from '@radiantearth/stac-fields';
   Formatters.allowHtmlInCommonMark = false;
   ```
* CrsCode (CRS Codes such as `EPSG:1234`)
* CSV (array to comma-separated values)
* Date
* DOI (generate a link for a DOI)
* Duration (ISO 8601 duration)
* EPSG (generate a link for an EPSG code - deprecated in favor of CrsCode)
* Extent (array with two values formatted as range)
* FileDataType (explains the data types defined in the file extension)
* FileSize (formats a number of bytes into kB, MB, ...)
* GridCode (formats the `grid:code` field)
* HexColor (formats a hex color to a box in this color)
* License (formats a license as link based on SPDX or the links)
* MediaType (converts media types into a more human-readable variant) - add `shorten:  true` to the field spec to render a shorter version
* PROJJSON (formats PROJJSON into a more human-readable variant)
* Providers (formats an array of providers)
* Shape (formats an array containing shape/size information, e.g. `proj:shape`)
* Software (formats the list of software as defined in the processing extension)
* TemporalExtent (array with two timestamps formatted as temporal range, see Timestamp) - add `shorten:  true` to the field spec to render a shorter version (i.e. date only)
* TemporalExtents (array containing a temporal extent per element, which is rendere using `TemporalExtent`, see above)
* Transform (makes 2D numerical arrays, e.g. the `proj:transform` field, better readable)
* Timestamp (ISO8601 timestamp formatted according to local rules)
* Url (Formats a STAC Link Object)
* WKT2 (splits a WKT2 string into nicely formatted chunks for better readability - experimental!)
* ... (see the source file for more)

### Custom formatters

Formatters are always functions that have the following signature:

`method(value : any, field : string, spec : object, context = null, parent = null) => string`

* `value` is the value of the field in the STAC JSON.
* `field` is the key of the field in the STAC JSON.
* `spec` is the normalized object for the field from the `fields.json`.
* `context` is the full STAC JSON.
* `parent` is the parent object, if any.

The returned value is always expected to be a string.
It may contain HTML if the formatter is added to the `htmlFormats` array in `fields.json`.
If the return value is allowed to contain HTML, ALL user input must run thorugh the `e()` function (or `parseInt` for integers, for example) to escape malicious HTML tags.
This avoids XSS and similar security issues.

### `I18N`

All properties on the I18N class should only be used in read-only mode.
You should use the following functions instead:

* `setTranslator(function fn)`: Set a function with parameters (phrase : string, vars : array|object = null) that can translate phrases.
* `setLocales(array<string> locales, object dateFormatterOptions = {}, object dateTimeFormatterOptions = {}, object numberFormatterOptions = {}, object collatorOptions = {})`: Set locales to be used for JS Intl functions.

### `Registry`

* `externalRenderer` (boolean): Set to `true` to not render custom objects, arrays and tables with the renderers from this library. Will return formatted values individually then. Defaults to `false`.
* `addExtension(prefix : string, spec : object) => void` - Adds a additional (custom) extension that is compliant to the fields.json, can also be used to replace existing extensions
* `addMetadataField(field : string, spec : object) => void` - Adds a additional (custom) metadata field that is compliant to the fields.json, can also be used to replace existing fields
* `addLinkField(field : string, spec : object) => void` - Adds a additional (custom) metadata field only for links that is compliant to the fields.json, can also be used to replace existing fields
* `addAssetField(field : string, spec : object) => void` - Adds a additional (custom) metadata field only for assets that is compliant to the fields.json, can also be used to replace existing fields
* `addMetadataFields(specs : object) => void` - Adds additional (custom) metadata fields that are compliant to the fields.json, can also be used to replace existing fields

### Data Types (`DataTypes`)

This object has functions to format the native JSON data types as HTML strings: 
* array => `array(arr: array, sort: boolean = false) => string`
* object => `object(obj: object) => string`
* null => `null(label: string = 'n/a') => string`
* number => `number(num: number) => string`
* string => `string(str: string) => string`
* boolean => `boolean(bool: boolean) => string`

Additionally, it has a method `format(value: any) => string`, which applies the right formatting depending on the data type of the value.

All methods return strings, which may contain HTML. Input is sanitized.

### `Helpers`

* `e(str: string) => string`: Escapes the values for HTML output.
* `formatKey(key: string, prefix: boolean = false) => string`: Formats the property key nicely (e.g. the key `eo:cloud_cover` will be `Cloud Cover`). If `prefix` is set to true, the prefix will not be removed (e.g. the key `eo:cloud_cover` will then be `Eo Cloud Cover`). 
* `groupByExtensions`
* `isObject`
* `toLink(url: string, title: string) => string`: Converts a url and title to a HTML link (`<a href="$url" target="_blank">$title</a>`).
* `toList`
* `toObject`
* `hextoUint8`
* `uint8ToHex`
* `unit`
